/**
 * rpiv-wfex autonomy — suppress the mechanical human-confirmation gates that
 * live in rpiv-pi skill bodies (confirm slice / approve work / approve commit)
 * by injecting a high-priority system-prompt directive while a workflow run is
 * active. Gates are Markdown instructions the model chooses to follow, so a
 * before_agent_start directive overrides them at prompt priority (research:
 * "autonomy is a prompt-priority problem, not a code problem"). Gated to active
 * runs via the shared state slot so normal chat is untouched.
 *
 * Directive-only by decision (D3): tool_call can block but not answer, so it is
 * not used here. The one true safety stop (implement plan/working-tree mismatch)
 * is explicitly exempted (D4).
